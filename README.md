## Juicin'

Juice Up.
Lift Heavy.
Get Huge.


## How To Play

Keep your cool and avoid the other gym goers while lifting as many weights as you can.

Use juice to increase your gains! Be careful though, you'll also have less patience should you bump into anyone.

If you get too upset, drink some water to cool off.
