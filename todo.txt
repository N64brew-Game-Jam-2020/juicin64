Discrete levels play mode
    collect all the weights on screen each "day" to advance to the next "day"
    higher levels have more enemies total, or more difficult enemies
    this mode needs a separate high score list and a highest day reached list
    this mode is the original vision for this game

Start Menu
    add a logo
    add a barbell maybe?
    move the prep game loading functions here?

fix loading screen (pre-load music during intro logos)

move music loading to a background thread 
    main menu loading screen is due to pre-loading all music on main thread

different enemy types
    walks in medium size circle (square really)
    seeks and removes water bottles
    stops and changes axis every x steps
    slow, but always walks towards player

selectable music "stations" (playlists)
    96 FM, The Rock (the only implemented playlist, standard rock tunes)
    Chipper Radio (fast paced typical 'chiptune' music)
    Buzz'n FM (fast techno-leaning songs)
    Non-Stop Hop (hip hop influence songs)

Test Your Might - fun interlude / minigame
    Every x levels, or after scoring high enough in infinite mode
    similar to test your might from mortal kombat 1
    button mash to deadlift.
    view is zoomed in and only shows hands, shoes, bar
    after lifting, view pans over to show how many plates you lifted
